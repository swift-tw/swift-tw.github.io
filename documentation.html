  <p>Here, you’ll find documentation about the Swift language and the standard library. Apple has additional resources for learning Swift—such as videos, sample code and playgrounds, and additional documentation—at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/">https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-swift-programming-language">The Swift Programming Language</h2>

<p><em>The Swift Programming Language</em> is the authoritative reference for Swift,
offering a guided tour, a comprehensive guide, and a formal reference of the language.
You can download the latest version below.</p>

<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>

<p>Although the ePub of <em>The Swift Programming Language</em> above is provided in English, we encourage you to participate in translating this document to other languages. The best way to do so is to get involved with an existing translation project or start a new one where there’s a need. A great example of this is the GitHub project for the Chinese translation:</p>

<p>If you know of a quality translation project underway, please let us know on the <a href="https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-dev">swift-dev</a> mailing list, and we’ll do our best to provide a link to that project from this page.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-guidelines">API Design Guidelines</h2>

<p>One of the goals of the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution" title="Swift Evolution repository">Swift 3.0 release</a> is
to provide a set of API design guidelines for writing Swift code. The
current <a href="api-design-guidelines.html">draft API design guidelines</a> capture
guidelines for naming as well as the use of various Swift features in
your code.</p>
