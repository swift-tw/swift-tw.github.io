  <p>The design of commonly-used libraries has a large impact on the
overall feel of a programming language. Great libraries feel like an
extension of the language itself, and consistency across libraries
elevates the overall development experience. To aid in the
construction of great Swift libraries, one of the major <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/README.md" title="Swift 3 goals">goals for
Swift 3</a> is to define a set of API design guidelines
and to apply those design guidelines consistently.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The effort to define the Swift API Design Guidelines involves several
 major pieces that, together, are intended to provide a more cohesive
 feel to Swift development. Those major pieces are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Swift API Design Guidelines</strong>: The actual API design guidelines
are under active development. The latest draft of <a href="/documentation/api-design-guidelines.html" title="Swift API Design Guidelines">Swift API
Design Guidelines</a> is available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Swift Standard Library</strong>: The entire Swift standard library is
being reviewed and updated to follow the Swift API design
guidelines. The actual work is being performed on the
<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/swift-3-api-guidelines" title="Swift 3 Standard Library updates">swift-3-api-guidelines branch</a> of the Swift
repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Imported Objective-C APIs</strong>: The translation of Objective-C APIs
into Swift is being updated to make Objective-C APIs better match
the Swift API design guidelines, using a variety of heuristics. The
<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0005-objective-c-name-translation.md" title="Better Translation of Objective-C APIs into Swift proposal">Better Translation of Objective-C APIs into Swift</a>
proposal describes how this transformation
is done. Because this approach naturally involves a number of
heuristics, we track its effects on the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
frameworks, as well as Swift code using those frameworks. The <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-3-api-guidelines-review" title="Swift 3 API Design Guidelines review repository">Swift
3 API Design Guidelines Review</a>
repository provides a way to see how
this automatic translation affects Swift code that uses Cocoa and
Cocoa Touch. Specific Objective-C APIs that translate poorly into
Swift will then be annotated (for example, with <code class="highlighter-rouge">NS_SWIFT_NAME</code>) to improve
the resulting Swift code. While this change primarily impacts Apple
platforms (where Swift uses the Objective-C runtime), it also has a
direct impact on the cross-platform <a href="/core-libraries" title="Swift core libraries">Swift core
libraries</a> that provide the same APIs as Objective-C
frameworks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Swift Guideline Checking</strong>: Existing Swift code has been written
to follow a variety of different coding styles, including the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html" title="Objective-C Coding Guidelines for Cocoa">Objective-C
Coding Guidelines for Cocoa</a>. By leveraging
the heuristics used to import Objective-C APIs, the Swift compiler
can (optionally!) check for common API design patterns that don’t
meet the Swift API Design Guidelines and suggest improvements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Swift 2 to Swift 3 Migrator</strong>: The updates to the Swift standard
library and the imported Objective-C APIs are source-breaking
changes. This effort will involve the creation of a migrator to
update Swift 2 code to use the Swift 3 APIs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
