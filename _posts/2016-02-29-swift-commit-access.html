  <p>Now that the Swift Continuous Integration system is established and proven, weâ€™d like to grant commit access on a more frequent basis to project contributors who have established a track record of good contributions.  If you would like commit access, please send an email to <a href="mailto:code-owners@swift.org">the code owners list</a> with a list of 5 non-trivial pull requests that we accepted without modifications.</p>

<p>For more details about what it means to have commit access, please see the <a href="https://swift.org/contributing/#contributing-code">Contributing Code</a> section.</p>
