  <p>We are delighted to introduce <a href="https://swift.org/playground-support/">Xcode Playground Support</a>
as part of the Swift open source community!</p>

<p>Swift developers can approach the language in many different ways. In
addition to the traditional command-line compiler and interactive REPL
one of the earliest experiences for many developers was through the
introduction of playgrounds in Xcode. Prior to Swift 3.0 and Xcode 8
this was only possible with the version of Swift included with Xcode.
The Xcode Playground Support project enables building a Swift toolchain
that includes everything necessary to integrate with the Xcode 8
playground experience. Playground Support will be included in
corresponding snapshots. Download a snapshot, install it, and select the
toolchain to work with the latest Swift features in Xcode playgrounds.</p>
