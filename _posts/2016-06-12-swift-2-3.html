  <p>We are pleased to announce <strong>Swift 2.3</strong>!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Swift 2.3 is a minor update from Swift 2.2.1.  The primary difference between
Swift 2.2.1 and Swift 2.3 is that it is intended to be paired with Apple’s
macOS 10.12, iOS 10, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10 SDKs.  It also updates the underlying
LLVM and Clang versions to match with those in the Swift 3 compiler.</p>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

<p>Sources for Swift 2.3 are available in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">swift-2.3-branch</code> branch on GitHub.</p>

<h3 id="downloads">Downloads</h3>

<h4 id="apple-xcode">Apple (Xcode)</h4>

<p>Swift 2.3 is available for free as part of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download">Xcode 8</a>.</p>

<h4 id="linux-ubuntu-1404-and-ubuntu-1510">Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 15.10)</h4>

<p>Official binaries for Linux will be available shortly after the upgrade to the
continuous integration system (which produces the binaries).  Note that for
Linux, Swift 2.2.1 and Swift 2.3 are nearly identical.  This post will be updated
once binaries are available.</p>
